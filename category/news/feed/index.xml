										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He said these things after a courtesy meeting with a delegation of four members of the British Parliament at the Rashtriya Guest House Padma on Saturday (January 27) at 1 pm.</p>
<p>Dr. Hasan Mahmud said that discussions were held with four members of the British Parliament regarding Myanmar. The tense situation in Myanmar&#8217;s Rakhine state did not happen suddenly. It&#8217;s been a few more days. Our border guards have been on alert there for a long time. A tense situation arose there after a few days. We have always sought the help of the international community. They are with us. If the international community puts pressure on Myanmar, they will be forced to take back their citizens (Rohingya).</p>
<p>He further said that the border guards of Bangladesh are on alert as the situation in Myanmar&#8217;s Rakhine state is once again tense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the report, the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah of Saudi Arabia has taken this initiative so that marriage can be conducted in the holy Mecca and Medina.</p>
<p>Experts say that this is a great opportunity for various institutions to come up with exceptional ideas for organizing weddings there, while preserving the sanctity of these two mosques.</p>
<p>A Saudi marriage official named Masoud Al Jabri said that there is religious consent in teaching marriage in mosques. The Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) once taught the marriage of a colleague in the mosque. Many of the local people in Madinah now perform marriage ceremonies in the Masjid al-Nabawi. </p>
<p>He said, Madina residents do this for various reasons. Many people in Medina traditionally invite all their relatives to the wedding. Most of the time the bride&#8217;s family cannot accommodate everyone in the house. As a result, marriage is taught by coming to the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque or the Kaaba. Many believe that it is auspicious if mosque marriage is taught.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If that is not possible, the independent parliamentarians want to make the parliament effective by following the directions given by party president Sheikh Hasina about what will be their role in the twelfth National Parliament for the next five years. A handful of Independent MPs were in favor of forming a separate alliance, but most of the Independent MPs did not agree.</p>
<p>Independent Members of Parliament will sit in a meeting with Awami League President and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at Ganabhaban this Sunday evening to take directions on what role they will take in the 12th National Parliament starting from January 30. Independent MPs who won a record number of 62 seats will meet at Ganobhaban at the invitation of the Prime Minister. In today&#8217;s meeting, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina can give necessary directions regarding the role of individual parliamentarians and reserved seats.<br />
Talking to several independent parliamentarians of Awami League, it is known that they will perform their duties in parliament as per instructions given by party president Sheikh Hasina regarding the role they will play in the national parliament for the next five years. Because, except for a few, all independent members of parliament are directly involved in Awami League politics and hold big positions. Therefore, the newly elected independent members of parliament are looking at the party leader.</p>
<p>Awami League President and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will be happy to see them in the role, they will act accordingly. They are unwilling to take any risk of ending their political career by displeasing the party. Rather, independent MPs want to try to ensure their party&#8217;s nomination in the next election by proving their efficiency in the parliament.</p>
